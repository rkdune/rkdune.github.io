For a brief moment, a curious group of 25 existed in a magical land between the town of Nettlecombe and the coast of Somerset. This adventure was a beautiful one, full of wonder, laughter, long walks, and playful mischief.

What follows are some photographs narrowly smuggled out through the door of the wardrobe as contraband, taken from the perspective of one traveler.

### Arrival

Aside from the history (the venue was listed in the 1086 Domesday Book!), the town of Nettlecombe was a place of serenity: groups of sheep and cows were roaming outside the estate in all directions.

Walking along the paths, I saw an aged and fallen oak tree (climbing which made for a peaceful reading spot), flowers dancing under sunlight, and rolling hills dotted with sheep. If you walked high enough, you could see across the Bristol channel to Cardiff.

### Break Day

We carpooled to the Somerset coast, a place where ammonites — historic fossils — could be seen in the rocks preserving an ancient history. If you ventured along the beach to the town of Watchet, you could come across jagged rows of sediment, a fun obstacle course courtesy of thousands of years of erosion.

Venturing into the town, I ate fish and chips and played cards with fellow campers. To our right was the docks, but with the water receded (the Bristol channel basin has the 2nd highest tidal range in the world), the boats were standing on dry land, a strange sight to behold.

### Ending

I arrived at PAIR tired from the journey and not knowing what to expect. I left with new bonds of friendship and a tiny spark of magic bouncing around my heart.

The door to Narnia has closed. I can’t ever go back. But I can hold the memory — the magic — forever in my heart.
