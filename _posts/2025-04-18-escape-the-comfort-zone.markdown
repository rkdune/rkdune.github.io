*Context: In April 2025, I went on an adventure with Hack Club to Shanghai, immersing myself in the city, and meeting other international Hack Clubbers and locals alike. What follows is a travel log from that experience, focused on the times I pushed past the comfort zone to connect with local students, shopowners, tech workers, and more.*

“Where your fear is, there is your task” — Carl Jung

There’s something magical to be said about “trusting the process." When you have a feeling in your heart that things will turn out great, fear, uncertainty — they all just fade away.

It doesn't start like that though. It begins with a tiny thought planted in your mind, a “what if”. *What if, despite all the obstacles in my way, I made it to Shanghai to have the adventure of a lifetime?* That little thought grew until it had conquered both mind and heart. Fear was replaced with confidence, and 3 months later I found myself looking out of a plane window at shipyards as I descended into Shanghai.

After a nerve-wracking language barrier at immigration, I had officially made it. I started to meet fellow travelers from all over the world at a Starbucks outside baggage claim, who had escaped their own comfort zone. These travelers, from Portugal, India, Hungary, Canada and more, would soon become close friends.

On the Didi (Chinese Uber) ride to the hotel, the fact I was in a different world became apparent. Outside my window, I saw sprawling metropolis, endless rows of high-rise apartments, and a line of train supports that stretched past the horizon. The most glaring difference: about 90% of cars on the roads were EVs, denoted by their green license plates. The endless city with its towering buildings seemed to envelop me. This was a new, strange land — a country of big proportions. There was a lot to learn.

At dinner the first day, I worked up the courage to use the few Mandarin phrases I had learned: “Hello,” “Nice to meet you,” “Thank you,” “This one,” and “My name is.” My pronunciation was corrected a lot—in Mandarin, your intonation or “tones” fundamentally change the meaning of the word. After trying some insane new foods (chicken feet!?), I left dinner with another word I could use: “zǎo ān,” meaning “good morning.”

The next couple days were a blur, from trying a whole new cuisine of food to experiencing beautiful gardens and temples. At Jade Buddha temple, I saw awe-inspiring budda statues and travelers who had made the pilgrimage to pray to these statues and write their wishes on little red cards, which were hung everywhere. Reading some of these cards, I saw wishes for good health, luck on their upcoming exams, and for their relationships to work out -- beautifully *human* things. Although I was a traveler from across the world, walking through the temple I felt profoundly connected with these people just as human beings.

I found the most joy in striking up conversation with locals, using my steadily increasing vocabulary. At Nanjing Road (a shopping area), I asked some local youth about the most popular Chinese clothing brands. At local coffee shops, I learned new words from baristas. One time, completely lost and with a dead phone, I asked strangers for directions. The first few conversations were the hardest, but once I got comfortable with being uncomfortable, these interactions became so fun. Something that eased this process was that everyone I talked to was remarkably friendly, especially if I made a good-faith attempt to introduce myself in their language first.

Some of the best insights I had into Chinese life were through conversations taxi drivers. Through my limited vocabulary and Google Translate conversation mode, one driver told me about how he’d been working as a Didi driver for 4 years after he moved to Shanghai, the stresses of his job, and the bad economic year. When I asked him about wealth inequality in China, he flipped my question on its head, professing his admiration for Jack Ma, and in general Chinese values of saving and working hard. Roughly translated, he stated, "[Jack Ma] keeps a level head when there is confusion." This was unexpected, and significantly updated my perceptions.

I also met incredible local shopowners, mostly by stumbling into hole-in-the-wall shops. My friend Edward took me to an amazing coffee shop, where I watched as the owner went through an intricate process to make a specialty filtered coffee -- a true artisan.

After wandering into a beautiful-looking shop (which turned out to be a semi-museum), we met a wonderful local called Mrs. Xu. She insisted we return again, where we met her daughter, as well as the owner of the shop. They kindly taught us how to mix scents, and I learned of the owner’s incredible story of leaving his Chemistry PhD to pursue his dream of starting his own scent shop.

After visiting the top of Shanghai tower, I went to grab dinner at a food court on the bottom. My friends got into a very funny language barrier situation when ordering food, where the cashier couldn’t understand anything they were saying, and Google Translate wasn’t helping at all. Just when everything seemed lost, a man named Eric swooped into save them, and we ended up eating dinner with him, talking about everything from his interest in materials science to automation in factories.

Midway through my trip, I switched locations to a technology district farther away from downtown. The event venue was called Spark Labs, a coworking space for youth focused on AI, and I quickly became fast friends with some of the local students hanging out there.

Simon, who hand-solders the most incredibly audio equipment, taught me about synthesizers and music production. This was such a cool experience, because I love artists like Daft Punk but I had no idea how electronic music was actually made. Simon taught me how to make sick beats on VCVRack, and programatically using SuperCollider.

I later grabbed dinner with him and his friend Koi, where I learned about what it’s like to grow up and go to school in China, as well as the state of AI in their country. Something I took away was to keep my eye on Qwen, which seems to have a much more talent resources than DeepSeek.

The next day I met up with Seven and Klein. Klein and I ended up coding websites together until we lost track of time. As we started to filter out of the Spark Labs office space, Klein and Koi invited me to their hacker house, where some of the Spark Labs crew lived. I met the other members of their house, and their cat, which they affectionately called “bro”. After the Spark Labs founder, Ryan, inducted me as an honorary Spark Labs member, we debated theories of consciousness and played Catan late into the night. The Spark Labs organization is *super* awesome, which you can tell just from their awesome motto: "Everything begins with a spark." Although in the USA, similar entrepreneurship programs and hacker houses are common in cities like New York and SF, what Spark Labs is doing is new to China, and they're succeeding. I learned how in China, there's new crops of talented young people willing to take risks to start companies, as evidenced by AI startups like Manus that have gone viral even in the Unites States. There's also growing AI industry in technology hubs like Hangzhou, a city I hope to visit when I return.

The next day, I came across courts where local tech workers were playing pickup basketball. I formed a team with two fellow travelers, later joined by a local ByteDance engineer. The games were extremely competitive, and very fun. Apparently NBA is a huge thing in China, and I saw a lot of NBA jerseys, and Jayson Tatum / LeBron James posters around the courts.

I knew I had to cap off my magical trip with something that might actually be magic: the Shanghai maglev train to Pudong Airport. As the levitating train sped through the city at 190 mph (300 kmh), the half-second glimpses of buildings, parks, and people felt like a goodbye to a city that had welcomed me, and gave me something more than I could have ever asked for.
