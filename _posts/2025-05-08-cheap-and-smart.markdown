We have innovation all wrong. What we’ve come to think of as innovation is, in reality, an upgrade. Upgrades are useful because they advance the capability frontier. But they're not changing the game. The difference between an iPhone today and one 5 years ago is much less than the difference between the first and fifth iPhone. If you consider the first 5 years of digital camera innovation, the last 5 years would look like nothing has changed.

Of course, the first couple of years of every new technology will show rapid progress. And that’s not to say there aren’t tremendous leaps in technology happening every year. However, on a large scale, technology is becoming saturated.

So what can ambitious innovators around the world do about it? Right now, I think there’s a tremendous opportunity to build in a different direction, enabled by a brand new tool at everyone’s disposal: units of intelligence.

The past couple of decades of innovation have seen the replacement of analog processes with digital ones. Shopping at a bookstore? Amazon’s online marketplace made that easier. Looking for information? Google’s PageRank algorithm put the world’s information at your fingertips.

**Innovation is fundamentally about leverage: doing more with less.** Software is then by definition, extremely leveraged. You can develop it once and deliver it to any device with an internet connection, with extremely low to zero cost of replication and maintenance. With software, you can get a lot more capability out of whatever you’re doing, whether it’s selling books or looking for information, with less per unit cost and effort.

If the internet and computers changed our innovation curve from ‘pre-digital world’ to ‘digital world’, harnessing intelligence will change our curve from ‘digital world’ to ‘intelligence world’. With this we can get magnitudes more capability for the same cost. This makes me really excited. A whole new category of product is going to be invented: **cheap and smart**.

An awesome example of this is, funnily enough, AirPods. Before AirPods, if you wanted premium sound quality, you would have to pay big bucks for great speakers, maybe a studio room, and other things that either cost you time or money to obtain. Apple, though, took a different approach. They made a noise-cancelling algorithm and put a chip inside their earbuds so that this could happen in real-time. Just like that, Apple brought noise-cancelling technology (high capability) to the masses (for low cost).

AlphaFold is an AI algorithm that can predict the 3D structure of a protein in seconds with atomic accuracy. Previously, scientists had to do a time-consuming and costly process that could take days or weeks: make homology models, culture bacteria, insert the protein into the bacteria’s genome, induce expression of the protein, and characterize it with tests like NMR spectroscopy. The disruptive impact of AlphaFold was so great that when you talk to biochemists, they will regularly use the term “pre-AlphaFold world” to describe the experimental procedures they had to do previously to get any sort of data.

**So let’s start thinking about the future, and what we can make ‘cheap and smart’.** In medicine, what if we could take inexpensive low-field MRIs and make them as good as the world’s most advanced MRIs with intelligent algorithms? What if we can create $100 dollar retinal cameras and make them as good as the $100,000 ones? (I actually spent 3 exciting years working on this.) Can we use genetic sequencing to predict every disease we’ll ever have in a lifetime?

In sports, can my tennis racket tell me my personal optimal string tension and swing weight? Can a running shoe also adaptively pace you as you run a marathon? 

When I’m producing my YouTube videos, can my video editor proactively clean my audio, cut bad takes, and keyframe animations? Can my camera automatically find my best photos, or even better, suggest a composition and setting profile?

If we choose innovation over upgrades, the possibilities are endless.
