Hi! Thank you for stopping by. I'm Rohan, and I'm interested in things like mechanistic interpretability, machine unlearning, and neuroAI.


My favorite scene from any movie is in Interstellar when Cooper casually reprograms the honesty and humor settings of TARS, his superintelligent, robotic assistant. This is so magical! In contrast with today's opaque AI systems, I want to bring us to a point where humans can precisely control the behavior of our AI models. I believe this will be very important for both AI safety and allowing much more useful human interaction with AI.

In my free time, I also like to make [educational videos](https://youtube.com/@PapersAreWonderful) explaining my favorite papers. For example, my [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKozVZoXAYs) about Sparse Autoencoders has garnered over 600 views!

I love great coversations with new people I meet. If you want to reach out, feel free to send me an email at: rohantkalia [at] gmail [dot] com
