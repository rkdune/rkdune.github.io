Hi! Thank you for stopping by. I'm Rohan, and I'm interested in things like mechanistic interpretability, AI control, and neuroAI.


My favorite scene from any movie is in Interstellar when Cooper casually reprograms the honesty and humor settings of TARS, his superintelligent, robotic assistant. This is so magical! In contrast with today's opaque AI systems, I envision a world where humans can precisely understand and adjust the behavior of our AI models, enabling both safer and more effective human-AI interaction.

In my free time, I also enjoy producing [educational videos](https://youtube.com/@PapersAreWonderful) explaining my favorite papers as a resource to the community. For instance, my [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKozVZoXAYs) about Sparse Autoencoders has garnered over 1.8 thousand views!

I love great coversations with new people I meet. If you want to reach out, feel free to send me an email at: rohantkalia [at] gmail [dot] com
