Hi! Thank you for stopping by. I'm Rohan, and I'm interested in things like mechanistic interpretability, machine unlearning, and neuroAI.

In my free time, I also like to make [educational videos](https://youtube.com/@PapersAreWonderful) explaining my favorite papers. For example, my [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKozVZoXAYs) about Sparse Autoencoders has garnered over 600 views!

I love great coversations with new people I meet. If you want to reach out, feel free to send me an email at: rohantkalia [at] gmail [dot] com
